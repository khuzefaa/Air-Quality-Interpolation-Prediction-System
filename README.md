# Air-Quality-Interpolation-Prediction-System
A comprehensive system for estimating air pollution levels in areas without monitoring sensors using satellite data, meteorological information, and advanced spatial analysis techniques. This tool combines machine learning regression models with geostatistical interpolation methods to provide accurate air quality predictions across geographic grids
The system addresses the critical challenge of air quality monitoring in underserved areas by leveraging multiple data sources including Sentinel-5P satellite observations, weather station data, and traffic information to predict PM2.5 concentrations. This supports SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by enabling better air quality assessment and public health protection.
